Next Steps:

Ok, so I have a scanner I can run all day that alerts me of the moving average
setups I like to trade. The next step is programming rules based on account
and position values / attributes... next rules to factor...
BROADLY:
1) Diversification - break down curated momentum stocks into separate categories
and assign different sector weightings based on macro thesis
2) Set risk limits - never risk more than 2 - 3% per trade?
                   -stops? Entire option premium = 2 - 3% acct?
3) Set market condition restrictions? Only enter trades during certain market
conditions?

*** Account / Portfolio Dictionaries before anything else ***

Start with Diversification.
