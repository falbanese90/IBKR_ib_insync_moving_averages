Next Steps:

Today I appended each stock bucket list to include related industry and sector.
It should be easy enough to append those lists with any extra data I may need bc
now I have a lot of practice with that. I want to keep things as simple as possible
for now until i have a working program to refine so I will set Industry and sector
maximums. Something like 15% position count sector exposure, 25% position account
industry exposure... something like that... easy. done.

As far as risk limits per trade... option premium = risk limit... somewhere b/t
2-4%.

What else? Read old Trading Plan to see...


BROADLY:
1) Diversification - break down curated momentum stocks into separate categories
and assign different sector weightings based on macro thesis
2) Set risk limits - never risk more than 2 - 3% per trade?
                   -stops? Entire option premium = 2 - 3% acct?
3) Set market condition restrictions? Only enter trades during certain market
conditions?
0) Add SetContentString text for easier twitter posting
1) Upload directly to twitter or stocktwits.
2) Autonomous paper trading.
3) Autonmous live trading.

Trading program will execute trades at 2 - 4% of account in a diversified manner while using moving averages as support / resistance levels. Play with option chains next to determine which contracts and strike prices to buy.
